`analysis_and_plots.ipynb`:<br>
This is the main file in this repository. It draws upon the data in the folders in this repository, which are copies of those provided <a href="https://github.com/DBerke/Berke_et_alia_2022_supplemental_data">here</a>. It provides the Python 3 code for the analysis conducted in the paper and also to create the plots in the paper. The code is (lightly) commented so that someone who has read the paper carefully (including Supplementary Materials) and understood the analysis can understand it.<br><br>
